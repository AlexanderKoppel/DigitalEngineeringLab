## Technical Whitepaper

This folder contains a whitepaper draft titled:

**"From BIM to Digital Twin in Infrastructure Projects"**

It summarizes key learnings from my work on large-scale infrastructure design and BIM automation, especially how we transitioned toward:
- Semantic data structures
- Multi-system integration
- Digital twin readiness
- Early support for Industry 4.0 data exchange models

The document is intended for R&D and engineering audiences interested in bridging civil design and industrial software ecosystems.
