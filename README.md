From BIM to Digital Twin in Infrastructure Projects

This is a showcase of applied R&D work at the intersection of civil engineering, BIM automation, and Industry 4.0.

It includes selected prototypes, templates, and technical reflections based on my experience in major infrastructure projects across Europe (AFRY, WSP, Renaissance/Heitkamp), with focus on:

- BIM-to-Digital Twin workflows
- Parametric and semantic modeling
- Integration with emerging industrial standards (AAS, OPC UA)
- Tool development and automation (C#, Python, Grasshopper)
