## Grasshopper Parametric Tools

This folder contains Grasshopper (.gh) definitions used for parametric modeling and metadata control in early-stage design and BIM workflows.

Applications include:
- Smart geometry generation based on constraints
- Attribute-driven object creation
- Automated grouping and classification for BIM export
- Experimental setups for object-level semantic tagging

These were used in pilot projects bridging geometry and structured data for future digital twin use.
